# CalorieCalc

Just a quick calculator for my partner's project  
The premise, as explained to me, is the gained Calories being the intake throughout the day, lost Calories is what you lost in activity, and then you divide the subtracted sum (made into a whole positive number) by 3500. That number supposedly being the Caloric equivalent to 1LB. 
  
This script just does the math for you and writes it into a dated text file.
